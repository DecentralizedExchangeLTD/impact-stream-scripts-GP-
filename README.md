## Scripts

1. Deploy the QV Impact stream strategy. _(Verify the contract if it's not auto verified)_

pnpm run deploy-strategy
```
2. Update `ALLO_STRATEGY_ADDRESS` in `.env` with the deployed contract
3. Update `pool.data.json` with the init data for pool creation. (_verify the timstamps and allo strategy address_)
4. Create pool on Allo using deployed strategy
```shell
pnpm run create-pool
```

5. Update `ALLO_POOL_ID` in `.env` with the pool Id
6. Head over to `impact-stream-app` and update [allo.config.ts](https://github.com/0xPrimordia/impact-stream-app/blob/develop/src/app/%5Blocale%5D/config/allo.config.ts) with the right addresses and poolId
7. Create Profiles from the Proposals in impact stream. (_Each proposal has a profile on the registry_)
```shell
pnpm run create-profiles

8. Next for every user with an approved proposal, we need deploy a safe which owned by the user wallet and impact stream multisig.  Update `IMPACT_STREAM_MULTISIG_ADDRESS` in `.env` with the wallet that will be the other signer

pnpm run calculate-payouts
```

13.  Once the allocations has ended, to set the payouts on chain, run
